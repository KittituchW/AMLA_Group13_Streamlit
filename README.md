# 🪙 Crypto Insight – Group 13 (UTS AMLA AT3)

**Repository:** `AMLA_Group13_Streamlit`  
**Deployed App:** [Crypto Insight on Streamlit](https://kittituchw-amla-group13-streamlit-appmain-irplhq.streamlit.app/)

---

## Overview

**Crypto Insight** is an interactive web application for **real-time cryptocurrency forecasting and analysis**, developed as part of the **UTS Advanced Machine Learning Applications (AT3)** project.

The app serves as the **front end** for multiple deployed machine learning models, enabling users to explore **historical market data**, **technical indicators**, and **next-day price predictions** for four cryptocurrencies:
- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Solana (SOL)**
- **XRP**

Built with **Streamlit** for simplicity and smooth integration with Python analytics, the app connects directly to **FastAPI endpoints** hosted on **Render**, fetching live data from the **[Kraken OHLC API](https://api.kraken.com/0/public/OHLC)**.

Since the API doesn’t provide technical indicators, the application **computes them locally**, including, **RSI** and **moving averages**, before generating visualizations and model inputs.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is organized to keep the Streamlit web app, API integration, and model files modular and easy to maintain.

## Main Functionalities

### 1. Interactive Visualization
Displays historical **OHLC** data and calculated indicators such as **RSI** and **moving averages** using **Plotly** charts.  
Users can visually explore price patterns and market trends.

### 2. Real-Time Prediction
Select a cryptocurrency to view the **predicted next-day high price**, generated from the deployed **FastAPI models**.

### 3. Model Performance Dashboard
Compares model performance across all algorithms using key evaluation metrics:  
**RMSE**, **MAE**, **MAPE**, and **R²**.

### 4. Team and Model Overview
Shows each team member’s assigned model along with its performance metrics and project role.

### 5. Data Refresh and Caching
Includes a **refresh button** for updating predictions and cached data with `@st.cache_data`, ensuring fast loading and reduced API calls.

## Setup and Launch Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_link>
cd amla_group13_streamlit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies  
Install all required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  
You can do this by running the command: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if you are using **Poetry**, run: 

```bash
poetry install
```

### 3. Run the Application Locally  
After installing dependencies, start the Streamlit app by running: 

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py 
```

This will launch the web application in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

### 4. Access the Deployed Version  
You can also access the deployed version directly at:  
[Crypto Insight (Streamlit App)](https://kittituchw-amla-group13-streamlit-appmain-irplhq.streamlit.app/)

The application connects to the **FastAPI model endpoints on Render**, fetching real-time cryptocurrency predictions and displaying model performance metrics.
